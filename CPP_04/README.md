A virtual class in C++ is a class that contains at least one virtual function.
A virtual function is a function in a base class that is declared using the virtual keyword, and is meant to be overridden in derived classes.
The concept of virtual functions is used to support polymorphism in C++, which allows related objects to be treated as a single type.

To use a virtual class in C++, you first need to declare a class with at least one virtual function using the virtual keyword. Here's an example:

```c++
class Animal {
	public:
		virtual void makeSound() = 0;

};
```

This is the Animal class, which contains a single virtual function called makeSound. 
		"(The pure specifier (= 0) syntax is used to declare a virtual function);"-->ex02;
Note that this function is declared as pure virtual by including the = 0 after the function declaration.
This means that the Animal class is an abstract class, and cannot be instantiated on its own.

To use this Animal class, you need to create a derived class that overrides the makeSound function. For example:

```c++
class Cat : public Animal {
	public:
		virtual void makeSound() {
			cout << " *** MEOW ***" << endl;
		}

};
```

This derived class inherits from the Animal class and overrides the makeSound function.
Now you can create objects of the Cat class and use them polymorphically, treating them as if they were Animal objects even though they are actually Cat objects.

The main advantage of using virtual classes in C++ is that they support polymorphism, which allows related objects to be treated as a single type. This can make it easier to write code that is more flexible and reusable.
For example, you could write a function that takes a "Base" object as an argument and calls the "doSomething" function on that object, even if the actual object passed to the function is a "Derived" object.
The function would automatically call the overridden "doSomething" function in the "Derived" class, without the need for any additional type checking or casting.

So virtual classes in C++ are a powerful tool for supporting polymorphism and writing more flexible and reusable code. They are particularly useful when working with large and complex object-oriented code bases.
